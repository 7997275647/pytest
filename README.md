# Pytest Project Template

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the usage of `pytest` for testing Python code. The project includes examples of various `pytest` functionalities such as mocking, fixtures, parameterized tests, and conditional test execution using `xfail` and `skip`.

The aim of this project is to showcase best practices for writing robust, maintainable, and scalable unit tests in Python.

## Features

- **Unit Testing**: Ensures the functionality of individual components.
- **Fixtures**: Provides reusable test setups for consistent test execution.
- **Mocking**: Isolates external dependencies for pure unit testing.
- **Parameterized Tests**: Tests the same logic with different sets of inputs.
- **Conditional Testing**:
  - `xfail`: Marks tests expected to fail.
  - `skip`: Skips tests based on conditions.
- **Detailed Test Reports**: Generates verbose test results and optional coverage reports.
